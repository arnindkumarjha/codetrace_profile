# codetrace_profile Framework

## Overview
The `codetrace_profile` framework is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to profile Python code execution. It allows developers to measure the performance of their code, identify bottlenecks, and optimize their applications.

## Features
- **Profiler Class**: The core functionality is encapsulated in the `Profiler` class, which provides methods to start and stop profiling, as well as to generate reports.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes helper functions for formatting time and logging events, making it easier to interpret profiling data.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here is a basic example of how to use the `codetrace_profile` framework:

```python
from codetrace_profile.profiler import Profiler

# Create a profiler instance
profiler = Profiler()

# Start profiling
profiler.start()

# Code to be profiled
# ...

# Stop profiling
profiler.stop()

# Get the profiling report
report = profiler.get_report()
print(report)
```

## Running Tests
To ensure that everything is working correctly, you can run the unit tests included in the project:

```
